[REGISTRATION FORM BELOW]

Welcome to our first monthly meetup for those interested in Quantum Computing!

This meetup will focus on the introductory theory behind quantum computing, its potential, and limitations, and will help you build your first circuit to see how quantum computing differs from classical computing and teach you to manipulate qubits through quantum logic gates.

The meetup will start out with an introduction by our local members, where we will speak about the potential of Quantum Computing and its applications.

After a short seminar to give you the required theoretical knowledge, we will primarily be working in tutorial Jupyter notebooks that will help you through the process of constructing, simulating, and testing your first quantum circuit.

Concluding the session we will be joined by Junye, an Advocate from IBM's quantum computing community over a video call where he will talk about developing quantum games.

We, of course, encourage you to discuss and bond with your fellow participants as you will begin to see familiar faces as the community grows.

On: January 24, 2020
At: PES University
From: 09:00 AM to 03:00 PM

Prerequisite: Knowledge of Python. It is a big advantage to be familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, but we will be sending out an e-mail to participants before the actual meetup.

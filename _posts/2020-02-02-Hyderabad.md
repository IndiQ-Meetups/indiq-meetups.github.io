Welcome to our first monthly meetup in Hyderabad for those interested in Quantum Computing!

Here's our Agenda:

1) Get you up to speed with the basics of Quantum Computing including a bit on the business landscape. (qubit to quantum algorithms)

2) Dive straight into Qiskit and program a REAL QUANTUM COMPUTER through the IBM Q platform! How cool is that!?

3) Get to sit in a short lecture by Prof. Indranil Chakrabarty from IIIT Hyderabad who will be talking about the applications of Quantum Computing and ongoing research.

4) End the session with a video conference with Huang Junye (Qiskit Advocate) from CQT who will teach us how to build "Quantum Games"!

5) Networking with Pizza!

Prerequisite: Knowledge of Python. It is a big advantage to be familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, but we will be sending out an e-mail to participants before the actual meetup with the resources.
